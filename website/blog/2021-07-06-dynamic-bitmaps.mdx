The dynamic bitmap is a solution that made PixiEditor work multiple times faster, decreased RAM usage 10 times, and solved memory leak problems. 
This article will explain what it is and how it works.

# History

Dynamic bitmaps have been introduced in very early alpha version v0.0.3, before that PixiEditor image system was pretty straightforward.

Mouse click was converted into relative canvas coordinates, and then color was applied to the pixel at a given position. Pretty simple, however, this solution 
had one big downside. PixiEditor uses [WriteableBitmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.imaging.writeablebitmap?view=net-5.0)
to manipulate bitmaps and working on bigger canvases using this solution yielded bad performance and huge memory consumption.

So what was the solution? Dynamic bitmaps!

# What is a dynamic bitmap?

In a simple words, dynamic Bitmap is a bitmap that fits the size of its content. This is extremely important in the layer system.
Here is a visual representation of how it works
