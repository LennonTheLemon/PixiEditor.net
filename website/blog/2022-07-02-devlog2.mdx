Hello pixel makers, as the time goes, PixiEditor v1.0 is closer and closer. We have some exciting 
updates and progress to announce.

<!--truncate-->

# Current status

We are addressing most wanted features and improvements for this release, we took all of this seriously and 
rewritten core codebase from ground-up. At the moment of writing this devlog, new core is waiting to be 
integrated into our main codebase and connected with the UI. 

Simultaneously we were working on 3 big features, palettes, shortcuts and search. One of them (palette system)
is already available on development channel and you can test it yourself!

Let's dive into the details.

# Palette system

Palettes are extremely important for good drawings, and up until now, we only had swatches system, which
simply saved colors that were used on canvas while drawing. Comparing swatches to palettes in PixiEditor 1.0
is like trying to compare a raft with a yacht. It literally took _months_ of development time.

Interested? Let's break things down!

## Palette Viewer

Palette Viewer is simillar to the Swatches tab, it stores current palette and allows to manage it.

We can see a few things there. 

Top bar contains buttons to add colors, copy swatches into palette, open palette browser, import palette
from disk and save palette.

Then, there are colors! Who would've guess? Click on them to select as a primary drawing color.
You might've noticed that first 10 colors contain some numbers, from 1 to 0, they are, in fact, shortcuts.

Clicking 1 on keyboard will select first color as your primary, simple, yet time-saving. But don't worry, 
they are more quality of life features.

At last, bottom bar, this one is a little misterious at first glance.
It's a color replacer. Drag color to a first field, click on second to pick desired color and hit replace button.
Not only it will replace color in palette, but also on the canvas!

## Palette Browser

Palette Browser is a place, where you can find all stored palettes, from the ones you've created, to the ones downloaded from the internet.

Lookin' good, doesn't it?

First thing, you can see all palettes in the list. You can also search for palettes by name, filters and mark them as favorite. You can also import
them from your palette viewer, disk or ...import directly from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list) by clicking "Open in app" button.  

Here is how it looks in action:

## Search

Search lets you do everything you can do inside of PixiEditor, with just one search bar.

For example, you can quickly open any recently opened file, do most of the things you do with your mouse, but more quickly and it has some nice extra features for making you more productive.

To open it, just click on the new search bar at the top of the window or press the shortcut, which is set to Ctrl + K by default.

This opens up the new search bar.

You can basically enter anything in here and it finds it if PixiEditor has it.

But there are a few other neat things you can do with it.

### Color Input

You can quickly type in colors to select them in the color picker.

#### Pro tips:

#1 Press Ctrl + R to quickly insert the rgb pattern.

#2 Just press space in the rgb pattern after typing in a number to go to the next value.

#3 Press Ctrl + S to switch between rgb and hex.

### File Path

You can type in a path to a file to open it.

As you can see in the screenshot, by starting the path with a '~' you can start from your users directory.
