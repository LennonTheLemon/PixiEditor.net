Hello pixel makers, welcome to PixiEditor v0.1.7 development blog post. We have excited news to share
about our latest version. Major rework is going on, a lot of new features and bug fixes.

<!--truncate-->

# What was going on for past few months

We decided to rework from ground-up the most important PixiEditor part. Drawing backend. 
This rework will open a lot of doors for us. From huge performance boost, to easier and quicker
cross-platform port. So version v0.1.7 is mostly performance improvements and optimalizations.
Except that, we are working really hard on fixing existing bugs (and not creating more), 
new exciting features, UI changes and more.

# Port to SkiaSharp

 From now on, PixiEditor will use Skia as drawing backend. Skia is a image processing library made by Google.
 It's extremely performant and increased drawing speed, to the point, where pen size equal to 300px 
 is actually usable.

While this is a great news, we are still facing some issues, that are yet to be solved for stable release.
Almost every aspect of the core code was affected, and we had to rewrite a lot of crutial components.
Like undo system, tools, custom layer rendering and much more.

# New features

PixiEditor still lacks a lot of features, and we are adding more and more of them for each version.
Same applies to this one.

## Layer grouping and hierarchy

This is a biggest feature coming to v0.1.7, from now on, you'll be able to create layer groups and 
enchance structure in your drawings. This took us almost 4 months to implement and it still is not perfect,
but we are pretty happy how it works already.

## Reference layer

Another interesting feature, we've implemented, is reference layer (image). Often, while testing PixiEditor,
we noticed, that we would like to have full-resolution image as a background to our drawings, so this is how
reference layer came to live. You'll be able to select any image from the disk and it will fit your canvas
in uniform size.

## Rotate and flip document/layers

Pretty self-explainatory, PixiEditor didn't have any rotation and flipping options, now, you'll be able
to rotate whole document and individual layers (currently 90 degrees, custom angle planned for v0.2).

## Magic wand tool

More tools, more selection capabilities. Magic wand tool selects area with same color. Simple and effective.

# Other changes and improvements

Also, we've replaced WPF Extended Toolkit zoombox with a custom one, that is more responsive and more
user-friendly. There are a lot of new things, and a lot of them not mentioned in this post.

There are also numerous bugs fixed (and a few new ones as well).

# Summary

We are happy with the current status of PixiEditor v0.1.7, but It's still not ready. New features, reworked core, lots of 
bug fixes, new tools and many more. Stay tuned for more.
