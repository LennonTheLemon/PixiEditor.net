Hello pixel makers, finally, after years of development, PixiEditor 1.0 is released! Check out new exciting features, changes and what's coming next.

<!--truncate-->

# Overview

This blog post is going to cover a lot of things, I really recommend reading it all, but if you want, you can skip some parts using navigation on the right.

## Some history

PixiEditor came a long way since 2017, yes, 2017. It's hard to believe it's been six years. Of course first 3 years were pretty slow in development, it was just a fun, learning-focused side project. Right now, however, it's something bigger. For the first year, PixiEditor was hidden from the world, only my hard drive knew the depths of pixel-assembling software, called back then "[Pixi](https://github.com/flabbet/Pixi)". 

![Pixi alpha screenshot](/img/blog-posts/1.0/alpha-screenshot.png)

It was bad, really bad, but without it, PixiEditor 1.0 would never happen.

First public version of rebranded Pixi was released in October 10th of 2018, from that day, it's known as PixiEditor. In 2019, very little happened, only one, little update was released. Mostly because I worked on other projects and PixiEditor was just one of many I started back then. But I've seen potential in it, a lot of potential.

There are a lot of pixel-art focused apps like Aseprite, Piskel, Pixel Studio or Pixelorama, not mentioning general purpose raster graphics editors like Photoshop or Gimp, which can be configured to draw pixel arts. The market seems crowded, doesn't it? Why would anyone need yet another app? The answer is...User Interfcae and user experience.

Let's face it, the world is ruled by propriatary software. If you ask random person if he knows what Photoshop is, most likely, he heard about it at least once in his life. What about GIMP then? Well, it's slippery slope from here.

I noticed that a lot of open-source programs, even powerful ones, tend to expose their features to users in unpleasant ways, either visually or in terms of intuition. To back up my statement, here are some examples.

### Blender

Extremely powerful and popular 3D app, before version 2.8, using it was a pain. Thankfully v2.8 solved that issue, but it's still a good example, since open-source blender was released in 2002 and version 2.8 in 2019, so whooping 17 years of pretty bad UI and UX, confusing shortcuts, and navigation.

### Inkscape

Now let's check out most popular free and open-source vector graphics editor.

![Inkscape](/img/blog-posts/1.0/inkscape.png)

WHOAH, that's a lot of buttons, what do they do? I don't know, I just want to draw a simple line.

![Straight Line Button](/img/blog-posts/1.0/StraightLine.png)

Ok, it is written here that this tool can create a straight line. Let's draw one then.

<video src="/img/blog-posts/1.0/where-is-my-line.mp4" controls width="600"/>

Uh oh, where is my line? Even dragging the box around requires surgical precision. 

After 10 minutes of trying to find the answer in official manual, online forums and by clicking things in the app I finally found that you have to hold Shift and click on color to set stroke color.

![stroke-color](/img/blog-posts/1.0/stroke-color.png)

Not very intuitive for a beginner, right? After even more time, I found fill and stroke menu, which exposes all the options the way it should've in the first place. Why it doesn't show automatically?
Why top bar doesn't have a button to toggle it? 

I don't know.

### Audacity

This is an interesting example, because Audacity is probably one of the most popular audio editing software known to man, outrunning other, propriatary ones. But UI and UX, oh boy, just look at that.

Don't get me wrong, I love audacity and whenever I need to record or edit some audio, I use it.

All of mentioned programs are fantastic and used by many users and I totally get why, some of them are my apps of choice too.

But I think that the world needs free alternatives of paid programs, which look good, feel good and most importantly, are easy to use. And that's our goal.

All great, but what about pixel-art focused programs that are already on the market? 

Well, one true king currently, is Aseprite. Which is paid. Their pixelated UI style doesn't 
click for me, but it's rather subjective matter. The thing is, people who are used to 
Photoshop, probably need to learn Aseprite UI and shortcuts for a while, since the layout is a bit different.

We tried solving this by mimicing Photoshop's layout, people are used to it and finding stuff
should be easy. Of course PixiEditor has its own distinctive style, features and QoL elements.

But let's check what's really inside PixiEditor 1.0.

# What's new

We've listed some of new stuff in [previous devlog] <- put link, however I'll describe all of them in short.

## Palette system with Lospec integration

Dedicated system for managing color palettes, which allows to easily access colors with shortcuts
1,2,3, etc. The system consists of palette browser which is like a database for your palettes, you can quickly
access them, mark as favourite, delete, rename etc. 

![Browser-screenshot](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Palette-Browser.png)

One of the most interesting things it has is [Lospec Palette List](https://lospec.com/palette-list) integration. What does it mean?

Lospec is the most popular pixel-art site with great palette database, PixiEditor 1.0 supports their palette protocol, which allows you to import palette from their website with just one click.

## Symmetry

Achieving geometrical perfection takes time. But those 2 funky lines can help you with that.

It's like having 4 hands drawing simultaniously.

<video src="/img/blog-posts/1.0/Symmetry.mp4" controls width="700"/>

## New selection transformation

Selection now allows scaling and rotating (with pivot!). Mabybe one day we'll add skewing too.

<video src="/img/blog-posts/1.0/Selection.mp4" controls width="700"/>

## Lasso tool

[Yee-haw!](#new-selection-transformation)

## Command Search and editable shortcuts

Whole codebase in PixiEditor 1.0 was rewritten from the ground up. And thanks to that, we've built
quite robust command system, which allows to easily search for stuff and rebind shortcuts.

<video src="/img/blog-posts/1.0/CommandManager.mp4" controls width="700"/>

Not only you can use it to find actions, but also to parse colors!

## Layer Masks

Do you know those funny things that women put on their faces? Yeah, now imagine a woman face is a layer.
Got it? Good. Whole face is visible. Now if you create a mask (or put it on the face) you can't see 
the face at all. Now when you draw on the mask, you are removing parts of it from the woman face,
so you can see face parts underneath. That's how layer masks work.

## Clip layers

Layers are now clipable, which means you can use one layer as a mask for the other. 
Let's say you have a layer with a weapon, and you want to draw on top of it some patterns. Instead
of drawing on the same layer, you can now create new layer, clip it to the weapon layer and without a lot
of precision, draw on top of it.

[video]

## Lock layer alpha

It's like clip to other layer, but it allows to clip to itself. In other words,
if you toggle lock alpha, you won't be able to draw on transparent pixels on this layer.

[video]

## Blend modes

Blend modes define how colors from different layers mix together. PixiEditor 1.0 allows you to
change blend mode of each layer. Simple as that.

## Other stuff

There are way more things that I didn't mention, but listing all of them would take 
way too much space and time. You can check detailed changelog [here] <- put link.

# What's next?

PixiEditor doesn't end on 1.0, we have a lot of plans for the future. Hopefully 
they see the light of day. Here is a brief list of things that we want to implement.

## V1.1

For 1.1 we want to add localization support starting with 4 languages out of the box 
(English, Polish, German and Russian) and lanuch community translations for more.


## V2

For 2.0 we plan to port PixiEditor to new framework, AvaloniaUI, which
will allow us to run PixiEditor on platforms like Linux macOS and maybe web.
This is a ambitious goal, because it means we have to rebuild whole UI from the scratch,
but it's worth the effort. 

We don't have concrete plans for other features yet, but there will be something for sure! We thought about tile drawing, custom brushes,
FX, but we're not yet sure. Feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qSRMYmq) and talk about it with us!

## V3

Version 3.0 is exciting, because it'll bring animation creation tools. It's one of the 
most requested feature by our community and we want to do it good.

It's a far future, but we can't wait to show it to the world.

# Steam release

We are widening our distribution line, along with Microsoft Store, itch.io and our website,
we've launched PixiEditor on Steam! Of course for free. You can now easily track hours
spent in PixiEditor.
