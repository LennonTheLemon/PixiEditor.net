# Overview

- Steam release
- Tutorials

This blog post is going to cover a lot of things, I really recommend reading it all, but if you want, you can skip some parts using navigation on the right.

## Some history

PixiEditor came a long way since 2017, yes, 2017. It's hard to believe it's been six years. Of course first 3 years were pretty slow in development, it was just a fun, learning-focused side project. Right now, however, it's something bigger. For the first year, PixiEditor was hidden from the world, only my hard drive knew the depths of pixel-assembling software, called back then "[Pixi](https://github.com/flabbet/Pixi)".

It was bad, really bad, but without it, PixiEditor 1.0 would never happen.

First public version of rebranded Pixi was released in October 10th of 2018, from that day, it's known as PixiEditor. In 2019, very little happened, only one, little update was released. Mostly because I worked on other projects and PixiEditor was just one of many I started back then. But I've seen potential in it, a lot of potential.

There are a lot of pixel-art focused apps like Aseprite, Piskel or Pixelorama, not mentioning general purpose raster graphics editors like Photoshop or Gimp, which can be configured to draw pixel arts. The market seems crowded, doesn't it? Why would anyone need yet another app? The answer is...User Interfcae and user experience, UI/UX in short. 

Let's face it, the world is ruled by propriatary software. If you ask random person if he knows what Photoshop is, most likely, he heard about it at least once in his life. What about GIMP then? Well, it's slippery slope from here.

I noticed that a lot of open-source programs, even powerful ones, tend to expose their features to users in unpleasant ways, either visually or in terms of intuition. To back up my statement, here are some examples.

### Blender

Extremely powerful and popular 3D app, before version 2.8, using it was a pain. Thankfully v2.8 solved that issue, but it's still a good example, since open-source blender was released in 2002 and version 2.8 in 2019, so whooping 17 years of pretty bad UI and UX, confusing shortcuts, and navigation.

### Inkscape

Now let's check out most popular free and open-source vector graphics editor.

WHOAH, that's a lot of buttons, what do they do? I don't know, I just want to draw a simple line.

Ok, it is written here that it can create a straight line. Let's draw one then.

<video src="/img/blog-posts/1.0/where-is-my-line.mp4" controls width="600"/>

Uh oh, where is my line? Even dragging the box around requires surgical precision. 

After 10 minutes of trying to find the answer in official manual, online forums and by clicking things in the app I finally found that you have to hold Shift and click on color to set stroke color.

![stroke-color](/img/blog-posts/1.0/stroke-color.png)

Not very intuitive for a beginner, right? After even more time, I found fill and stroke menu, which exposes all the options the way it should've been done in the first place. Why it doesn't show automatically?
Why top bar doesn't have a button to toggle it? 

No one knows.

### Audacity

This is an interesting example, because Audacity is probably one of the most popular audio editing software known to man, outrunning other, propriatary ones. But UI and UX, oh boy, just look at that.

Don't get me wrong, I love audacity and whenever I need to record or edit some audio, I use it.

All of mentioned programs are fantastic and used by many users and I totally get why, some of them are my apps of choice too.

But I think that the world needs free alternatives of paid programs, that makes users feel like they use premium product, which looks good, feels good and, most importantly, is easy to use. And that's why I created PixiEditor.
