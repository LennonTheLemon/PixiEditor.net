# PixiEditor desktop app privacy policy

Our policy is very simple, we don't store _any_ of your data.

## Discord Rich Presence

PixiEditor supports [Discord Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to) API. This means, your status
is displayed on your discord profile while using PixiEditor. By default this option is enabled.

Default PixiEditor Rich Presence shares information about:
- Document size
- Layers count
- Time elapsed

All of the options can be disabled in the settings as well as Rich Presence itself.


Another thing PixiEditor uses internet access for, is to check updates. You can disable that option as well.
