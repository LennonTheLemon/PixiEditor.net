# Contributing to PixiEditor

Hey! Thanks for being interested in the project! It means a lot. This guide will help you get familiar with the codebase.

## Before you start

- Before you start writing code, it's best to discuss the things you want to add or fix. 
The quickest way to talk with us is on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/qSRMYmq).
You can also make an issue or comment on an existing one. 
If you want to work on an issue, keep in mind that some issues can be unexpectedly difficult, and some may even be invalid (since anyone can make one).

- We welcome early pull requests, in fact, you can make one before writing any code. 
This tells everyone what you are working on, and this way you'll be able to get feedback as you are writing code.

## The basics

* PixiEditor is written in C#, .NET 6
* We use WPF framework for the UI and SkiaSharp for everything related to drawing/painting.
* The app has two general parts
    * A GUI built in WPF (with plans to eventually switch to AvaloniaUI)
    * The PixiEditor's Core, the part that implements most of the functionality, like drawing, handling layers, keeping track of the changes for the undo system, etc.

## Code main points

[ViewModelMain](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/blob/master/PixiEditor/ViewModels/ViewModelMain.cs) is considered entry point of program. It is a DataContext to MainWindow, all initialization happens there.
