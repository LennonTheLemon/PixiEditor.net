# About

PixiEditor utilizes a quite complex undo system, yet easy to use after understanding a few concepts. The editor itself handles almost all the hard work and unless you are building some complex tool, implementing new things should come with ease.

# The UndoManager class

Generally, there are 3 methods, that you'll use while working with [UndoManager](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/blob/master/PixiEditor/Models/Controllers/UndoManager.cs).

- `AddUndoChange`
- `Undo`
- `Redo`

## `AddUndoChange`

This is a method that adds your change to [UndoManager](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/blob/master/PixiEditor/Models/Controllers/UndoManager.cs)

Example usage: 

```csharp
public int Number { get; set; }

public void ChangeNumber(int newNumber)
{
    UndoManager.AddUndoChange(new Change("Number", Number, newNumber, "Changed number", this));
    Number = newNumber;
}
```
---

There are 2 parameters, `Change change` and `bool invokedInsideSetter = false`.

- Change is a class that contains all the data about your undoable change.
- invokedInsideSetter is used to prevent infinite adding the same change when `AddUndoChange` is located inside the setter property of this change.


:::danger wrong
This Example will yield an infinite loop of adding changes to UndoManager
:::

```csharp
private int number;
public int Number
{
    get => number;
    set
    {
        UndoManager.AddUndoChange(new Change("Number", number, value, "Changed number", this));
        number = value;
    }
}
```

:::tip correct
By setting `invokedInsideSetter` to `true` this problem is gone.
:::

```csharp
private int number;
public int Number
{
    get => number;
    set
    {
        UndoManager.AddUndoChange(new Change("Number", number, value, "Changed number", this), true);
        number = value;
    }
}
```

# Different types of Change

## Property-based change

This is the most basic change type. It sets the property value on `Undo` and `Redo`.

```csharp
public Change(string property, object oldValue, object newValue, string description = "", object root = null)
```

- `property` is the name of the property that is affected, dot format is supported (ex. `NumberStore.Number`)
- `oldValue` is the value before the property was changed
- `newValue` is the value after the property was changed
- `description` is the description of the change, it's just a documentation
- `root` is the parent class that contains property, default is null, which points to PixiEditor `UndoChanges` property containing class (while writing this doc, it's: `ViewModelMain.Current.UndoSubViewModel`)

[Example is shown above](#addundochange)

## Process-based change

This type of change is significantly different from a property-based one. It doesn't set any values by itself, but rather executes a defined process (method/function/Action) on `Undo` and `Redo`.

```csharp
 public Change(Action<object[]> reverseProcess, object[] reverseArguments, Action<object[]> process, object[] processArguments, string description = "")
```

In this constructor, we have `reverseProcess`, `reverseArguments`, `process` and `processArguments`. The reverse process is a function that is called on `Undo` and the process is a function called on `Redo`. They both are Actions with `object[]` arguments. This kind of Undo is for more complex cases, where simple property changing isn't enough. PixiEditor mainly uses them, since working with images is a challenging task, and we do not store whole bitmaps in memory.

Example

```csharp

public WriteableBitmap Bitmap { get; set; }

public void SetBlackPixel(Coordinates position)
{
    object[] processArgs = new object[] { position };
    object[] reverseProcessArgs = new object[] { position, Colors.Red };
    UndoManager.AddUndoChange(new Change(RemovePixelProcess, reverseProcessArgs, SetPixelProcess, processArgs, "Set pixel to black"));
    SetPixelToBlack(position);
}

public void SetPixelToBlack(Coordinates position)
{
    Bitmap.SetPixel(pixelPosition.X, pixelPosition.Y, Colors.Black);
}

public void SetPixelProcess(object[] arguments)
{
    if (arguments.Length > 0 && arguments[0] is Coordinates pixelPosition)
    {
        SetPixelToBlack(pixelPosition);
    }
}

public void RemovePixelProcess(object[] arguments)
{
    if (arguments.Length > 1 && arguments[0] is Coordinates pixelPosition && arguments[1] is Color lastColor)
    {
        Bitmap.SetPixel(pixelPosition.X, pixelPosition.Y, lastColor);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are setting the pixel at some Coordinates to black, we have 2 methods that are used in undo, they are called processes, One is basically a wrapper for `SetPixelToBlack` with `object[] arguments` and second Undoes the setting pixel with `lastColor` which is red.

## StorageBasedChange

Some actions are unreversible, and cannot be recreated without saving the bitmap somewhere, that's where `StorageBasedChange` comes in. This change saves selected layers on the disk.

This class is basically a wrapper for normal Change, that injects some logic into `ReverseProcess` (undo) and `Process` (redo). Either you choose to save layers on each `Undo()` or `Redo()`, StorageBasedChange supports both approaches.

First, you need to construct an object and provide layers, which you want to save with some additional parameters.

The basic syntax looks like this: 

```csharp
StorageBasedChange(Document document, IEnumerable<Layer> layersToSave, bool saveOnStartup = true);
```

where

`document` - is a Document that contains layers to save.

`layers` - layers to save on disk

`saveOnStartup` - if true, layers are saved on disk after object initialization (in the constructor).

And the next this is to construct actual `Change`, which you can insert into `UndoManager` using `ToChange(...) function`.

One of the method overloads looks like this

```csharp
public Change ToChange(Action<Layer[], UndoLayer[]> undoProcess, Action<object[]> redoProcess, object[] redoProcessParameters, string description = "")
``` 

Where

`undoProcess` - is a method that will be executed on Undo, it needs to have 2 parameters and doesn't return anything. Both parameters are connected with restored layers from the disk.

The first parameter is a `Layer[]`, these layer array is loaded from disk, and you can do whatever with them.

The Second parameter is a UndoLayer[], this class contains information about the layer before saving, this is required since `StorageBasedUndo` saves only layer bitmap on disk (as a PNG).


`redoProcess` - is a basic method with object[] parameters, same as a normal Change process, but before calling this function, `StorageBasedUndo` saves layers on disk again.

`redoProcessParameters` - arguments for `redoProcess`

`description` - description of undo.

There are a few more overloads, one which swaps `Undo` with `Redo`, so you save layers on disk on `Redo` and restore on `Undo`, another adds the possibility to attach custom parameters to `Undo` etc.

Example of add layer undo (taken directly from PixiEditor).

```csharp

 StorageBasedChange storageChange = new StorageBasedChange(this, new[] { Layers[^1] }, false); //Constructing StorageBasedChange with last layer in Layers array

UndoManager.AddUndoChange(
    storageChange.ToChange(
    RemoveLayerProcess,
    new object[] { Layers[^1].LayerGuid },
    RestoreLayersProcess,
    "Add layer"));

private void RestoreLayersProcess(Layer[] layers, UndoLayer[] layersData)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < layers.Length; i++)
            {
                Layer layer = layers[i];

                Layers.Insert(layersData[i].LayerIndex, layer);
                if (layersData[i].IsActive)
                {
                    SetActiveLayer(Layers.IndexOf(layer));
                }
            }
        }

private void RemoveLayerProcess(object[] parameters)
        {
            if (parameters != null && parameters.Length > 0 && parameters[0] is Guid layerGuid)
            {
                Layer layer = Layers.First(x => x.LayerGuid == layerGuid);
                int index = Layers.IndexOf(layer);
                bool wasActive = layer.IsActive;
                Layers.Remove(layer);

                if (wasActive || ActiveLayerIndex >= index)
                {
                    SetNextLayerAsActive(index);
                }
            }
        }

```

# Summary

Undo system is quite complex, there are a lot of variations and possibilities, you've learned from this guide about most important aspects, you can find out more examples in source code and tests (they are a great source of knowledge!).
