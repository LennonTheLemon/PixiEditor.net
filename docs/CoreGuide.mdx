# PixiEditor's Core

## ChangeableDocument

The main goal of `ChangeableDocument` is to keep track of all changes done to a document. 
All changes are stored in a list, and they can be reverted and re-applied. This enables undo/redo functionality.

`ChangeableDocument` stores most of the data of a document. This includes document dimensions; all layers with their bitmaps, blend modes, etc.; 
all folders; selection; reference layer; other stuff. The data can be freely read from the UI, but the only way to write into it
is by using the `ChangeableDocument` change pipeline.

`ChangeableDocument` implements a pipeline which accepts `IAction` instances, modifies its document state based on them, 
and returns `IChangeInfo` instances. `IAction` instances describe user's actions, for example let's take a look at 
`ResizeCanvas_Action`. `ResizeCanvas_Action` is created and passed to the pipeline when the user resizes the canvas.
It contains the new canvas size. When `ChangeableDocument` accepts an action it creates a new instances of the change that 
corresponds to it, in this case `ResizeCanvas_Change`. 

### Changes

#### Regular Change

The "change" is an object that describes some modification made to the
document, like changing it's size. Changes have two main methods: `Apply` and `Revert`. `Apply` method applies the change,
in this case, it resizes the document to the new requested size, cropping the layer bitmaps. `Revert` goes the other way: 
it restores the original size of the canvas, resizes the layer bitmaps back to the original size, and draws the areas that
was previously cropped away. All data required to apply and revert the change is saved inside the change itself.

`Apply` and `Revert` functions return zero, one, or multiple instances of `IChangeInfo`. Each instance of `IChangeInfo`
concretely describes a change made to one or multiple properties, for example "Document size property changed from 64x64 
to 128x128". These ChangeInfos are passed to the UI, and they are utilized to update the state of the UI.

#### UpdateableChange

Some changes can't be applied right away. Let's take using a lasso tool to select an area as an example. When using 
a lasso tool, you first hold down left mouse button, then select the area, then release the button, and only then the 
final area is known. This means that the lasso change needs to get updates continiously while you are selecting.

This is what `UpdateableChange` is for. It has an `ApplyTemporarily` function that accepts updated data and returns
`IChangeInfo`s. `ApplyTemporarily` is very similar to `Apply`, but it can be called multiple times while you are selecting 
the area, and once you are done `Apply` is still called. If an updateable change gets reverted and then re-applied 
`ApplyTemporarily` is not called.

`UpdateableChange`s have two corresponding `IAction`s: the first one implements `IStartUpdateChangeAction` 
and is used to start and update the change; the second one implements `IEndChangeAction` and it indicates the end of 
the change.

Here is an example of how you'd use actions to execute updateable changes. This example changes layer/folder opacity,
like you would while dragging the opacity slider.

```csharp
// user started dragging the slider, start changing opacity of layer/folder with guid memberGuid
// initial value - 1.0f
// this will create an updateable change and call it's `ApplyTemporarily`
Helpers.ActionAccumulator.AddActions(new StructureMemberOpacity_Action(memberGuid, 1.0f));
...
// some time later, user dragged the slider to 0.5, update opacity to 0.5f
// this will call `ApplyTemporarily` of the active updateable change
Helpers.ActionAccumulator.AddActions(new StructureMemberOpacity_Action(memberGuid, 0.5f));
...
// some time later, when the user let go of the slider, end the change
// this calls `Apply` of the active updateable change
Helpers.ActionAccumulator.AddFinishedActions(new EndStructureMemberOpacity_Action());
```

#### LayerImageChunks_ChangeInfo

Whenever something is drawn on one of the layer bitmaps, the UI needs to know what area was updated. This info is used 
to re-render an area of the canvas in the UI. The task of `ChangeableDocument` is to report all updated areas on all 
bitmaps, and it uses `LayerImageChunks_ChangeInfo`. 

`LayerImageChunks_ChangeInfo` stores a hashset of coordinates
, where each entry indicates a position of the updated chunk on a bitmap. Each bitmap is split into many 256x256 chunks,
for example a 512x512 bitmap can contain up to 4 chunks (empty chunks are not stored). If you draw something in the 
bottom right corner it would mean that chunk with position (1, 1) is updated (the top-left chunk has position (0,0)).

Since keeping track of chunks that you modify can be very tedious, this functionality is built into `ChunkyImage`.
`ChunkyImage` is a class that represents a bitmap, and it is used throughout `ChangeableDocument` to store most of 
the bitmaps. Every bitmap I've referred to above is actually a `ChunkyImage`.

## ChunkyImage

`ChunkyImageLib` provides an image class specifically tailored to store the document's layers. It has an interface that allows 
you to modify image by enqueing various drawing operations. 

The drawing operations can be cancelled in an efficient way, allowing you to preview the changes before committing them. 
For example, cancelling is used when the user transforms a selected area, since the app needs to display the transformed image 
while it is being moved around. Every time transform position changes, the old image drawing operation is cancelled, 
and a new one is enqueued in the new position. Other examples include drawing shapes, using brushes, and in general to 
anything that requires continious input from the user with immediate visual feedback.

An image is stored as a set of 256x256 segments, or chunks. The drawing operations are applied individually and 
independently to each chunk. They are applied in a lazy fashion, chunks are updated to the latest version only if you 
try to access them. Moreover, there is an option to render chunks in low resolution. All of this enables PixiEditor to 
display the above mentioned "continuous" operations in a very efficient way: parts of the image not currently on display 
aren't being rendered, and if you zoom far enough the rendering system switches to using a low resolution.

## How ChangeableDocument uses ChunkyImages

In general, we draw on `ChunkyImage`s from various `Change`s and `UpdateableChange`s. As an example, let's take the `Apply` 
function of `ReplaceColor_Change`. `ReplaceColor_Change` operates on all layers, replacing one color with another, e.g. 
all red #FF0000 pixels are replaced by green #00FF00 pixels.

```csharp
public override OneOf<None, IChangeInfo, List<IChangeInfo>> Apply(Document target, bool firstApply, out bool ignoreInUndo)
{
	...
	// initialize a dictionary where old versions of the chunks will be stored
	// they are needed cause the change can get reverted in the future
	savedChunks = new();
	
	List<IChangeInfo> infos = new();
	// for each layer
	target.ForEveryMember(member =>
	{
		if (member is not Layer layer)
			return;
		
		// enqueue a color replacing operation in layer's ChunkyImage
		layer.LayerImage.EnqueueReplaceColor(oldColor, newColor);
		
		// find all chunks affected by currently enqueued operations
		HashSet<VecI>? chunks = layer.LayerImage.FindAffectedChunks();
		
		// save these chunks
		CommittedChunkStorage storage = new(layer.LayerImage, chunks);
		savedChunks[layer.GuidValue] = storage;
		
		// fully commit changes
		layer.LayerImage.CommitChanges();
		
		// create a new changeinfo for this layer
		infos.Add(new LayerImageChunks_ChangeInfo(layer.GuidValue, chunks));
	});
	// if no layers were modified, don't save this change in the undo/redo history
	ignoreInUndo = !savedChunks.Any();
	
	// return all created infos
	return infos;
}
```

Notice how we first enqueue changes in ChunkyImage, then get affected chunks, save them in `CommittedChunkStorage`, 
then commit them. This is a very common pattern, shared by many changes. `ApplyTemporarily` functions of 
`UpdateableChange`s usually don't commit the changes, as they may need to be cancelled on the next update (next 
call to `ApplyTemporarily`). Instead the changes are committed in the `Apply` function.
